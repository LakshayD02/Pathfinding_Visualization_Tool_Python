# Pathfinding_Visualization_Tool_Python
It allows users to visualize the behavior of two popular pathfinding algorithms: A* (A-star) and BFS (Breadth-First Search). The tool features an intuitive graphical interface where users can interactively set up obstacles and start points, then watch in real-time as the algorithms calculate and display the shortest path.
